# RubySnooper

RubySnooper is Poor man's debugger heavily inspired by [PySnooper](https://github.com/cool-RR/PySnooper)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby_snooper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby_snooper

## Usage

```ruby
class SampleClass
  extend RubySnooper
  snoop :sample_instance_method
  snoop_class_methods :sample_class_method

  def self.sample_class_method(arg1, arg2)
    arg1 = arg1 + 1
    arg3 = arg1 + arg2
    arg3 * 2
  end

  def sample_instance_method(arg1, arg2)
    arg1 = arg1 + 1
    arg3 = arg1 + arg2
    arg3 * 2
  end
end

SampleClass.new.sample_instance_method(1, 2)
SampleClass.sample_class_method(1, 2)
```

The output to stderr is:

```
